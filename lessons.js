          "üìç *Part 2: Key Features*\n\n- Immutable: Once data is added, it cannot be changed.\n- Distributed: Everyone has a copy of the ledger.\n- Transparent: Anyone can view the transactions.\n- Secure: Uses cryptography to secure the network.",
          "üìç *Part 3: Real-World Example*\n\nImagine a Google Sheet shared among thousands of computers worldwide. Every time someone edits it (adds a transaction), everyone can see it and must agree it's valid before it's saved. This is how blockchain ensures trust without a middleman."
