**Key Properties**
- üîí Immutable ‚Äî data can‚Äôt be changed once added  
- üåê Distributed ‚Äî everyone has a copy  
- üëÅÔ∏è Transparent ‚Äî anyone can view it  
- ‚ö° Secure ‚Äî uses cryptography

**Analogy**
Imagine a shared :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} file where every entry must be approved by all before it‚Äôs saved. That‚Äôs how blockchain keeps data honest.
