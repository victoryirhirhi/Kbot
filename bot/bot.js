**Introduction**
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} is a form of digital money that exists only online and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Unlike traditional currencies (like USD or NGN), no central bank or government controls it. It operates on decentralized networks called blockchains.

**Key Features**
- üíª Digital ‚Äî exists only online
- üè¶ Decentralized ‚Äî no central authority
- üîê Secure ‚Äî protected by cryptography
- üåç Global ‚Äî can be sent anywhere instantly

**Examples**
Popular cryptocurrencies include :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (BTC), :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} (ETH), and :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

**Why It Matters**
- Enables fast, low-cost cross-border payments
- Provides access to financial tools for the unbanked
- Offers alternative investment opportunities

      title: "How Blockchain Works",
      content: `
**Introduction**
:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies. It is like a public digital ledger stored across thousands of computers worldwide.

**How It Works**
- New transactions are grouped into blocks
- Each block is verified by many computers (nodes)
- Verified blocks are linked together in a chain

**Key Properties**
- üîí Immutable ‚Äî data can‚Äôt be changed once added  
- üåê Distributed ‚Äî everyone has a copy  
- üëÅÔ∏è Transparent ‚Äî anyone can view it  
- ‚ö° Secure ‚Äî uses cryptography

**Analogy**
Imagine a shared :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} file where every entry must be approved by all before it‚Äôs saved. That‚Äôs how blockchain keeps data honest.

      title: "Setting up Crypto Wallets",
      content: `
**What is a Wallet**
A :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} stores your private keys (digital passwords) and allows you to send, receive, and hold cryptocurrencies.

**Types of Wallets**
- **Hot Wallets** (online): Apps like :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}, :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} ‚Äî convenient but less secure
- **Cold Wallets** (offline): Hardware like :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} or :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} ‚Äî very secure but less convenient

**Setting One Up**
1. Download a trusted wallet app
2. Backup your recovery phrase (seed phrase) securely
3. Never share your seed phrase
4. Add funds by buying or receiving from others

- Enter amount and confirm

**Receiving**

- Wait for the network to confirm the transaction

**Safety Tips**
